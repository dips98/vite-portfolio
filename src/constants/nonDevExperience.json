    "description": "I taught six sections of robotics to 7th and 8th-grade students. The curriculum included basic computer science and robotics concepts, using lessons from Code.org and LEGO Education. I engaged students in daily hands-on learning by implementing the engineering/problem-solving process. My experience with robots and circuit boards includes Ozobots, BBC micro:bit, and the Spike Prime LEGO set.",
